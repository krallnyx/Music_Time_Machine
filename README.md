# Music_Time_Machine
A script creating a playlist of the 100 best songs on a specific day in the past.

In order to use this script, you'll need to have your own Spotify account in Developer mode:
https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/

You need to set your client_id as SPOTIFY_ID and your client_secret as SPOTIFY_SECRET in a .env file
You also need to set your redirect url to "http://example.com" in your spotify account

The first time you'll launch this script it will open your browser, you'll need to allow it to connect to spotify and copy the URL back to the script.

Enjoy :)
